    Linked List is a part of the Collection framework present in java.util package.
    This class is an implementation of the LinkedList data structure which is a linear data structure where
    the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.
    The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node.

Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.

    Advantages of using LinkedList in Java:
Dynamic size: As with Vector, the size of a LinkedList can grow or shrink dynamically, so you donâ€™t have to worry about setting an initial size.
Efficient Insertions and Deletions: LinkedList is an efficient data structure for inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the list because you only need to change the links between elements, rather than shifting all elements after the insertion or deletion point.
Flexible Iteration: With a linked list, you can efficiently iterate through the list in either direction, since each element has a reference to both its predecessor and successor elements.

Disadvantages of using LinkedList in Java:
Performance: LinkedList has a slower performance than ArrayList when it comes to accessing individual elements.
 This is because you need to traverse the list to reach the desired element, whereas with ArrayList, you can simply access
 the desired element using an index.
Memory overhead: LinkedList requires more memory than ArrayList because each element requires additional memory for the
 links to its predecessor and successor elements.
